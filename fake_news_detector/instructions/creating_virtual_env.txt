1. Change directory to the location of "fake_news_detector":
   Ex: "cd /path/to/fake_news_detector"

2. Create the virtual environment
  "python3 -m venv name_of_environment"  (change name_of_environment to desired name of environment)


3. Activate the virtual environment
  "source name_of_environment/bin/activate"

4. Upgrade to the latest version of pip
  "pip3 install --upgrade pip"

5. Install libraries from "required_libraries.txt" under fake_news_detector folder
   "pip install -r required_libraries.txt"

   If that doesn't work, then each library can be installed manually.
   "pip install pandas"
   "pip install scikit-learn"
   "pip install joblib"

Your virtual environment is now ready to use :)
