In order to use the fnd on your own system, you first have to create a virtual environment. 
Instructions can be found in "creating_virtual_env.txt". 
***YOU MUST CREATE YOUR OWN VIRTUAL WORKSPACE FOR THIS MODEL TO RUN***

Next, you must update the data in fake_news_dataset to fit your needs.
Instructions can be found in "updating_data.txt".

Next, we have to train the model to learn by using the fake_news_dataset
Run fake_news_train.py by using the command "python fake_news_train.py"

    How it works (skip if not interested): 
          First, we clean the text using a custom function to remove punctuation, numbers, and convert it to lowercase. 
          Then, we use the TfidfVectorizer tool from the scikit-learn library to split the cleaned text into tokens and transform it into a matrix of numerical values, which quantify the importance of words in the documents. 
          These features are then used to train a LogisticRegression model from the scikit-learn library to classify news articles as real or fake. 
          The trained model and vectorizer are saved using joblib for future use, allowing the model to make predictions on new, unseen text data.


Now we have to make edits to fake_news_predict.py. First, change the filepath of the model_path and vectorizer_path variables. 
Next, scroll to the bottom where you'll see this:

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "The stock market crashed due to economic uncertainty."

Change the sample_text to desired news article headline. 
Finally, run the document with the comman "python fake_news_predict.py"



Debugging:
If there was an error while loading the model or vectorizer, you will see the message:
    "An error occurred while loading the model or vectorizer:"
    This means that the filepath you inputted for model_path and/or vectorizer_path is wrong. However, there shouldn't be a problem.
    Your file path should be shown before that message:
    "Current working directory: [file path]" 
    Use that to make modifications :)
