Fake News Detector
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Overview:

  This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content using machine learning. 
  The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news headlines, processed with natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and evaluated for accuracy.


Features:

- Preprocesses text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and eliminating numbers.

- Converts text into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization.

- Trains a Logistic Regression model for classification.

- Evaluates the model using accuracy and classification reports.

- Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future predictions.



Dataset:

  The dataset is stored in fake_news_dataset.csv and contains:

  text: The headline or snippet of a news article.

  label: 0 for real news and 1 for fake news.

Installation:
  Download the project and look at the text file "using_the_FND.txt" under the instruction folder.
